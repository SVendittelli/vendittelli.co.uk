# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it through [GitHub's Security Advisories](https://github.com/SVendittelli/vendittelli.co.uk/security/advisories).

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

Please include as much of the information listed below as you can to help me better understand and resolve the issue:

- The type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help me triage your report more quickly.

## Preferred Languages

I prefer all communications to be in English.
