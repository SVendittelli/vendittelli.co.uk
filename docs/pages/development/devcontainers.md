title: Development Containers
---

> A Development Container (or Dev Container for short) allows you to use a container as a full-featured development environment. It can be used to run an application, to separate tools, libraries, or runtimes needed for working with a codebase, and to aid in continuous integration and testing. Dev containers can be run locally or remotely, in a private or public cloud. - [containers.dev](https://containers.dev/)

A development container for this project can be started locally using [VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) or [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces).

The dev container configuration can be found in [`.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`]({{ site.github.repository_url }}/tree/main/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json).
