I use VisualStudio Code as my IDE and the recommend extensions for the project can be found in [`.vscode/extensions.json`]({{ site.github.repository_url }}/tree/main/.vscode/extensions.json).

## Development Containers

The development environment is containerised and can be run using [Development Containers](devcontainers.md).

## Version Control

The project uses [git](https://git-scm.com/) for its version control system and is stored remotely on [GitHub]({{ site.github.repository_url }}). See [Version Control](vcs.md) for more information.
